# DynamicProperties

Adding the ability to add properties to objects at runtime with custom System.ComponentModel.PropertyDescriptor's.

These runtime added properties can only be read via the System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor.

Use case:
Introducing new properties to ViewModels. These properties work well with Databinding in WPF
